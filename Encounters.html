	  <h2> The Beginning</h2>
	  <p> The Xenomorph was first encountered in 2122, by the crew of the commercial towing vehicle, the UCSS Nostromo. One of the crew members was attacked by a fachugger, which quickly implanted the embryo in him, which rapidly grew out of him and burst through his chest, instantly killing him. It then disappeared, only to grow in size, and quickly pick of the crew one by one, until the final memner, Ellen Ripley, triggered the ships self-destruct, and escaped in the escape shuttle, However, The Xenomorph had stowed away in her ship, until she jettisoned it out of the airlock.

	  <h2> The Romulus Incident</h2> 
	  <p> 50 Years afer Ellen Ripley went into Cryosleep, the body of The Xenomorph is found floating in space, frozen, in a shell. It is taken aboard the Renaissance Space Station where it is studied and facehugger are grown based on its DNA. However, The Xenomorph, being the perfect organism, soon revives and wreaks havoc aboard the station, leaving no survivors. Finally, one of the final soldiers aboard the shp manage to kill it, only to trigger its defence mechanism: The creature has acid for blood, which dissolves all the way through the Renaissance, only for the resident scientific officer, Rook (A Synthetic) to barely seal it back up.  The station is found later by a group of young adults looking for a better life, to get the cryopods. They are soon attacked by facehugger, one of the embyros is implanted in them, and all are picked off excepet Rain Carradine, and her brother ND-255(Andy)  </p>
