	  <P> Weyland Yutani was a company around by 2122, was a large British and Japanese multinational conglomerate. It was founded in 2099, by the merger of Weyland Corp and the Yutani Corporation. They were mainly a technology supplier, manufactuaring synthetics, starships and computers for a wide range of industrial and commercial clients, making them a household name. The Company, however has other private intersets, willing to sarifice deceny and life in order to recieve the highest profits. The Company has also endlessly driven their employees and agents to obtain a living sample of the species designated "XX121 Xenomorph" so that the creatures can be exploited as biological weaponry or just for financial gain.

	  <h2>SYNTHETICS</h2> 
	  <P> Sythetics, also known as Artificial People are robots designed by the Weyland Yutani to seamlessly fit in to any surrounding. They made them in bathes at a time, one of the most notable being "Bishop" who was a Sythetic modelled after Mr "Bishop" Weyland. Most of them have hidden depths, after the sample of the Xenomorph's tissue.  </P>
