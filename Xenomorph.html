	  <P>The Xenomorph is a complex creature, first located on the planet LV-426. It has an interesting anatomical structure, with Sulphuric and Hydroflouric acid for blood, and the fact that it relies on a host to parisitize, in order to survive. 
 
      Firstly, there needs to be Queen Xenomorph ( although in the case where there is none, a xenomorph can turn it's victims into eggs, in a process called Eggmorphing) which lays eggs with facehuggers inside. In the prescence of a host, they will attach themselves to the hosts face, and lay and egg containing the xenomorph inside of them. It will then amalgamate with their DNA, and grow out of them as a result. It then will rapidly grow to its full size in less than 24 hours.
