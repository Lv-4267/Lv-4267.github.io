	  <P>The planet LV-426 , was just like any old planet, discovered by the crew of the commercial towing vehicle, the USCSS Nostromo. They were on their return voyage to Earth and were 10 months away from it, when a mysterious distress signal reached the ship. The captain of the ship,Arthur Dallas, questioned the ships onboard computer, MU/TH/UR 6000, and they landed on the planet. Executive Officer Thomas Kane went out to investigate, and found a chamber with many oval shaped eggs. He peered into one, just as an alien facehugger leaped out at him.
